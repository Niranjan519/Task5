1. Introduction and Data Overview
The objective of this analysis was to explore the train.csv (Titanic) dataset using statistical methods and visualization tools (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover key patterns and relationships, particularly concerning survival.

Data Quality Assessment
Observations: The dataset contains 891 entries.

Missing Data: Cabin (High missing values: 77%), Age (20% missing), and Embarked (2 missing values).

Data Cleaning: Cabin was dropped. Age was imputed with the median. Embarked was imputed with the mode ('S'). Irrelevant identifiers (PassengerId, Name, Ticket) were dropped for the core analysis.

2. Key Findings: Survival Factors
A. Univariate Analysis
Survival Rate (Target): Only 38.4% of the passengers in the training set survived (Survived=1), indicating a significant majority (61.6%) perished.

Passenger Class (Pclass): The 3rd class was the most numerous group by far, followed by 1st class, and then 2nd class.

Age Distribution: The age distribution is slightly right-skewed, centered around the median age of 28. A large number of younger passengers (around 20-35) are observed, along with a distinct peak for infants/young children.

Fare Distribution: The fare is highly right-skewed, suggesting most passengers paid low fares, with a few high-cost outliers (first-class passengers).

B. Bivariate Analysis: Survival Correlation
The following variables showed the strongest correlation with survival, following the "Women and Children First" policy:

Gender (Sex): This is the strongest predictor.

Survival Rate for Females: Approximately 74%

Survival Rate for Males: Approximately 19%

Observation: Females were overwhelmingly more likely to survive than males.

Passenger Class (Pclass): Class played a crucial role, reflecting socio-economic status and location on the ship.

Survival Rate (approx.): 1st Class (~63%) > 2nd Class (~47%) > 3rd Class (~24%).

Observation: Passengers in higher classes (1st and 2nd) had a significantly better chance of survival.

Age (Age):

Observation: The density plots show that the "Survived" distribution has a slightly higher density around the 0-10 age group compared to the "Not Survived" distribution, confirming that children had a higher chance of survival. The majority of the "Not Survived" density is centered around young adults (20s-30s).

Port of Embarkation (Embarked):

Passengers from Cherbourg (C) had the highest survival rate (~55%), followed by Queenstown (Q, ~39%), and Southampton (S, ~34%).

C. Multivariate Analysis: Correlation Heatmap
The correlation matrix highlighted the relationships between key features:

Feature	Correlation with Survived	Finding
Sex (Encoded)	+0.54 (Strong Positive)	Being female strongly correlates with survival.
Fare	+0.26 (Moderate Positive)	Higher fare (associated with 1st Class) correlates with survival.
Parch	+0.08	Having parents/children slightly correlates with survival.
SibSp	-0.04	Having siblings/spouses slightly negatively correlates with survival.
Age	-0.06 (Weak Negative)	Age is not a strong linear predictor, but older passengers were slightly less likely to survive.
Pclass	-0.34 (Strong Negative)	Being in a higher class (Pclass 1 is lower value) strongly correlates with survival.

3. Conclusion
The Exploratory Data Analysis confirmed the widely known historical findings: the key factors determining survival on the Titanic were Gender (females were prioritized), Socio-Economic Status (higher Pclass passengers survived at higher rates), and to a lesser extent, Age (infants and children had a survival advantage). The analysis provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling.
